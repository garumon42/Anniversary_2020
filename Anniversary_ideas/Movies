So there are three categories.

1. Rom Com
2. Romantic
3. Broadway

Ideally we can find a short that will do

Criteria - must be relatively recent (she said after 2000, but she probably means 2010)

ALSO - Plan for intermission - Watching this thing all in one go might be too much.
Maybe there's a short film that will do...

1. Romantic Comedy

1. The Big Sick - I love Kumail
2. The Artist - Is this actually a romcom? Plus it looks old so she probably wont like it
3. Silver Linings Playbook - I heard this was actually good and it's recent.
4. Trainwreck - Maybe need more info
5. Top Five - Looks funny
6. The forty year old virgin - Maybe

2. Romantic Movies

1. The Shape of water - Are we going to laugh off the mermaids?
2. Crazy, Stupid, Love - Has a lot going for it (Steve Carell)
3. La La Land - YAS

3. Broadway -

1. An American in Paris - It's on PBS.
2.
